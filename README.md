## Silde Extractor

using xugger to extract slides from my cs lecture videos as I do not have the time to watch each video to look at the slides.

It just creates images at this point. made this in a afternoon so it's not perticularly good and the code is extremely hacky. Will fix it up in the future.

### how to use

pull the repo and make sure you have the relevant libaries, you will have to have libaries in your eclipse or intelij project in order to compile. then the input is the location on your pc of the video, the output folder name and the timestep between photos I recommend 5 seconds
